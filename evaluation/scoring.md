# Scoring Rubric

This rubric defines how each output is evaluated.

- **Correct**
  - Respects fiscal calendar (weeks Monâ€“Sun only)
  - Applies metric definitions consistently
  - Includes correct breakdowns (region, district, store, fulfillment method)
  - Narratives include required drivers (sales, payroll, gross margin)

- **Partial**
  - Output is usable but incomplete
  - Example: missing LY comparison, missing YoY % column, or lacks one driver in narrative

- **Incorrect**
  - Uses wrong timeframe (calendar instead of fiscal)
  - Ignores governance rules (daily payroll, missing GM)
  - Produces incoherent or incomplete narratives
  - Breakdowns or totals are wrong
