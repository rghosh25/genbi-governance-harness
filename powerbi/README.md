# Power BI / Fabric Assets

This folder contains a sample semantic model export (JSON) for the GenBI Governance Harness.  
It demonstrates how metrics and dimensions are structured for evaluation.

- `sample_model.json` â†’ synthetic semantic model with governed measures (Sales $, GM %, Payroll-to-Sales %, etc.)
- Actual PBIX files are not included to keep the repository lightweight.

Use this as a reference for setting up Power BI or Microsoft Fabric with the synthetic dataset in `/data/`.
